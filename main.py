# main.py -- runs automatically on power-up (MicroPython convention: any file
# named main.py on the device root is run after boot).
#
# What this does: polls the LSM6DSOX as fast as I2C allows, and runs a
# classic seismology-style STA/LTA (short-term-average / long-term-average)
# trigger on the deviation of the acceleration vector's magnitude from its
# resting value. STA/LTA is what real seismometer software (e.g. ObsPy's
# recursive_sta_lta) uses too: a short EMA tracks "what's happening right
# now," a long EMA tracks "the ambient noise floor," and a trigger fires
# when the ratio between them spikes -- which adapts to your specific
# mounting location's normal vibration level instead of using one fixed
# threshold that might be too twitchy in a noisy spot or too dead in a
# quiet one.
#
# Using the acceleration vector's *magnitude* (not a single axis) means the
# sensor doesn't need to be mounted perfectly level or in any particular
# orientation -- at rest, |x,y,z| is always ~1g regardless of which way is
# "up" for the board.

# IMPORTANT while testing: WARMUP_S below only blocks *triggering* -- the
# LTA (ambient noise floor) and baseline keep updating the entire time,
# warmup included. If you shake the board hard during those first 90s to see
# if it "works," that shake gets absorbed into LTA as if it were normal
# background noise, which raises your effective threshold for the next
# ~30-90s (LTA's own time constant) even after warmup ends -- so a second
# test shake right after can look like it "doesn't trigger" when really the
# first shake poisoned the baseline. Power-cycle, leave it completely still
# for the full warmup, *then* do your test shake.
